**Document: Relationship between The SCP Foundation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)**

## Overview

The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) relationship with The SCP Foundation is shrouded in much more obscurity than its interactions with The Bureau. The existence of The Foundation, its true purpose, and extent of its operations are entirely unknown to the FBI, while select interactions are framed under the umbrella of special operations under the Bureau.

## Assumed Association with The Bureau

The Foundation operates, in the eyes of the FBI, as an undisclosed special operations department of The Bureau. Its agents are often involved in investigations when The Bureau calls them in to handle cases of a "special" nature. Despite this, the FBI remains largely ignorant of the Foundation's true mandate and scale, with the Bureau as the intermediary.

## Intervention and Control

Occasionally, Foundation agents take over investigations initiated by the FBI. This typically occurs when a case intersects with the Foundation's mandate of securing, containing, and protecting anomalous objects and entities. In these situations, the transition is made seamless under the pretext of escalating the case to a special division of The Bureau. The FBI's involvement is usually curtailed promptly, and all traces of the anomalous are expertly obscured.

## Information Exchange

Unlike its relationship with The Bureau, the FBI has no direct line of communication with the Foundation. All exchanges are handled by Bureau operatives under the Inter-Organizational Affairs Department. The information flow from the Foundation to the FBI is strictly one way, ensuring that the Foundation's operations remain veiled.

## Liaison Division

The Bureau's Inter-Organizational Affairs Department's Liaison Division coordinates the infrequent interactions between the Foundation and the FBI. The Division ensures a smooth transition in cases where Foundation agents take over, while also facilitating plausible reasons for the Foundation's interventions.

## Crisis Management

In scenarios where a significant event threatens the exposure of the supernatural world, the Foundation steps in swiftly, with the Bureau facilitating damage control with the FBI and other relevant agencies. Plausible cover stories are put forth, and measures are taken to prevent the spread of information that might hint towards the Foundation's true nature.

## Regulations and Policy

Similar to the Bureau, the Foundation operates under stringent non-disclosure policies with the FBI. However, the level of enforced unawareness is much more profound. Foundation agents interacting with the FBI typically operate under assumed identities as special operatives of The Bureau.

The relationship between the Foundation and the FBI is essentially non-existent, with all interactions carefully curated through The Bureau. The Foundation's mandate to maintain normalcy and protect reality often sees it functioning independently of, and sometimes in direct contradiction to, typical law enforcement procedures, necessitating this veil of secrecy.
