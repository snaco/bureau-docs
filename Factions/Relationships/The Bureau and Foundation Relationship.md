**Document A: The Relationship between The Bureau and The SCP Foundation**

1. **Organizational Directives**: While both The Bureau and The SCP Foundation are dedicated to addressing anomalies and preserving the peace and normalcy of human life, their specific methods and priorities differ. The Bureau's primary objectives are to Assess/Research, Assimilate/Relocate, and Neutralize, focusing on humanity's safety and knowledge. The SCP Foundation, on the other hand, emphasizes the Secure, Contain, and Protect directives, where the protection of reality's fabric takes precedence, even if it means making sacrifices at the earthly level.

2. **Integration vs Containment**: The Bureau's approach to anomalies involves their assimilation into society, whenever possible, and relocation when not. The SCP Foundation does not aim to integrate anomalies but focuses on their containment within the Foundation to mitigate their influence on reality.

3. **Neutralization**: The Bureau employs neutralization as a last resort against insurmountable threats to humanity. The SCP Foundation, with its nuanced understanding of anomalies and their impacts, acknowledges that eliminating anomalies can sometimes create larger, unanticipated problems and often disrupt the delicate balance holding reality together.

4. **Information Dissemination**: Information flow differs significantly between the organizations. While The Bureau encourages information sharing among its branches, the SCP Foundation operates on a more need-to-know basis. A substantial amount of knowledge within the SCP Foundation is not shared with The Bureau, and only essential or directly commanded information is relayed.

5. **Relationship**: The relationship between the organizations is characterized by mutual distrust but necessary cooperation. The SCP Foundation maintains a secretive stance, holding its cards close, and only shares what it deems necessary with The Bureau, unless explicitly commanded by THE BOARD.

6. **THE BOARD**: THE BOARD is a shared commanding structure to both The Bureau and The SCP Foundation. It's members are known only to the Administrators of both The Bureau and The SCP Foundation. Even then, the SCP Foundation holds a deeper understanding of THE BOARD compared to The Bureau.

The necessity of this relationship lies in the shared goal of both organizations: the protection and preservation of humanity and reality as we understand it. Although their methods differ, their mission with regards to humanity is ultimately the same.
