**Document: Relationship between The Bureau and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)**

## Overview

The Bureau maintains a complex yet necessary relationship with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). While operating in vastly different domains, the two agencies do intersect in their goals of national and global security. Their relationship, while mostly covert, is based on an intricate balance of limited cooperation, non-interference, and managed disclosure.

## Shared Interests and Cooperation

The Bureau and the FBI share a common interest in the safety and security of the United States. Occasional cooperation becomes necessary when a case involves both mundane and paranormal elements. These collaborations are handled with utmost discretion to uphold the Bureau's directive of global unawareness.

## Non-Interference

The FBI has an unspoken agreement of non-interference in Bureau operations. The FBI handles ordinary criminal investigations, while the Bureau is entrusted with supernatural cases.

## Managed Disclosure

The FBI, like the rest of the world, is kept unaware of the true extent of the Bureau's operations and the supernatural world. However, selective and controlled information is provided to key individuals within the FBI when necessary, through the Bureau's Department of Public Relations. The number of individuals in the FBI privy to the existence of the Bureau and its operations is extremely limited, often restricted to high-ranking officials.

## Crisis Management

In case of a major event that threatens to expose the supernatural world, both organizations have agreed to a mutual crisis management protocol. This includes the creation of plausible cover stories, coordinated efforts to control the spread of information, and joint operations to neutralize the source of the crisis.

## Liaison Division

The Inter-Organizational Affairs Department of the Bureau has a dedicated Liaison Division that maintains a direct line of communication with the FBI. This division coordinates any necessary cooperation, manages the controlled disclosure of information, and mitigates potential conflicts between the two organizations.

## Regulations and Policy

Non-disclosure agreements are in place for those few within the FBI who are aware of the Bureau's existence. Any violation of these agreements is taken seriously and could lead to severe consequences, including memory wiping or reassignment.

It is important to note that while the relationship between the Bureau and the FBI is necessary for national security, it is fraught with potential complications. Therefore, it is handled with utmost care to ensure mutual respect, non-interference, and the successful accomplishment of both agencies' respective missions.
