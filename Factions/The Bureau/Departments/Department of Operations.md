## Overview
The Department of Operations is the Bureau's primary arm of direct action. Its agents are the first responders and front-line workers in matters of anomalies. The department plays a critical role in maintaining the safety and stability of our world in the face of the unknown.

## Objectives

1. **Field Operations**: Conduct on-ground operations for anomaly assessment, interaction, or neutralization under directives from relevant departments.

2. **Collaboration with the SCP Foundation**: In the case where containment is necessary, it is the Department's responsibility to ensure that all necessary intelligence is transferred to  of the Department of Inter-Organizational Affairs (IOA). During containment operations by the Foundation, Operations agents are expected to accompany Foundation operatives to report back to the Bureau. However, Bureau agents are strictly prohibited from entering The Foundation without direct approval from the Board of Directors. Their duties concerning containment thus conclude once field operations are complete.

3. **Anomaly Management**: Implement strategies for anomaly management as directed by the Department of Assessment or the Department of Neutralization.

4. **Response Team Coordination**: Coordinate with response teams across The Bureau and other organizations as necessary.

5. **Agent Training**: Provide comprehensive and continuous training to field agents to handle a broad spectrum of anomalies.

## Codes and Regulations

1. **Protocol Adherence**: Agents must strictly adhere to Bureau protocols during field operations to ensure safety and effectiveness.

2. **Inter-departmental Cooperation**: Cooperation with other departments, such as Information, Neutralization, Relocation, and Inter-Organizational Affairs is crucial for operational success.

3. **Training Compliance**: Agents are required to complete all designated training programs and stay updated on new protocols.

4. **Data Reporting**: Agents must provide comprehensive and accurate reports of field activities for review and analysis.

5. **Respect for Anomalies**: Agents must respect the anomalies they encounter, understanding their potential risks and values to The Bureau and the world at large.
