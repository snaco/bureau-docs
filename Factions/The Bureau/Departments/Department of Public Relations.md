## Overview
The Department of Public Relations is the Bureau's outward-facing division, responsible for managing the Bureau's reputation with the public, the government, and other institutions. While the Bureau operates largely under the veil of secrecy, there are times when careful communication with the outside world is required.

## Objectives

1. **Maintain Secrecy**: Ensure that the Bureau's work remains undisclosed to the public, maintaining a veil of secrecy to protect the public and the Bureau's operations.

2. **Manage Relationships**: Oversee the Bureau's relationships with government entities, law enforcement agencies, and other relevant institutions. This includes liaising with the Department of Legal Affairs and the Department of Inter-Organizational Affairs as needed.

3. **Crisis Management**: In the event of a breach or other public-facing incident, the department is responsible for controlling the narrative and minimizing the damage to the Bureau's reputation.

4. **Public Messaging**: Craft and release necessary public communications under direct orders from the Board of Directors or in collaboration with other departments.

5. **Employee Communications**: Manage internal communications within the Bureau, fostering a sense of unity and purpose among employees.

## Codes and Regulations

1. **Secrecy First**: Any and all communication must uphold the Bureau's need for secrecy. Any breach of this policy will be taken seriously.

2. **Authorization Required**: Public messages must be authorized by the Board of Directors or by relevant department heads.

3. **Consistent Messaging**: All public messaging should align with the Bureau's mission and values.

4. **Crisis Management**: In the event of a crisis, the department should take the lead in managing the situation and controlling the narrative.

5. **Interdepartmental Cooperation**: The department should cooperate closely with other departments, especially Legal Affairs and Inter-Organizational Affairs, to ensure all public-facing actions are in line with the Bureau's overall objectives and legal constraints.
