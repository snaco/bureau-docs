## Overview
The Department of Integration and Relocation is specifically focused on aiding humanoid entities, especially those from fantasy races, to fit into human society or to relocate them to safe zones that are shielded from human populations. For humanoid entities that can pass as human, the department facilitates integration, often working closely with the Department of Reintegration to support them. For those that cannot pass as human, they are relocated to dedicated, hidden safe zones where they can live without posing a risk to or being at risk from the human population.

## Objectives

1. **Integration**: Facilitate the societal assimilation of humanoid entities that can pass as human.

2. **Relocation**: For non-human entities that cannot pass as human, ensure their safe relocation to dedicated safe zones that are hidden from human populations.

3. **Risk Assessment**: Collaborate with the Department of Information to assess any potential risks posed by integrated or relocated entities to themselves, to society, or to the safe zones.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement mechanisms to monitor the condition and activities of integrated or relocated entities and make necessary adjustments in their integration or relocation plans.

5. **Policy Development**: Develop and refine integration and relocation policies and procedures in line with the Bureau's goals and in response to an evolving paranormal landscape.

## Codes and Regulations

1. **Ethics and Respect**: Entities targeted for integration or relocation must be treated with respect and their rights upheld.

2. **Confidentiality**: Confidentiality of the identities and details of the integrated or relocated entities must be maintained unless there is a clear need-to-know basis.

3. **Risk Management**: Any potential risks identified during the integration or relocation processes should be immediately reported to the Department of Operations.

4. **Interdepartmental Collaboration**: The department should maintain close collaboration with other departments, particularly Reintegration, Operations, and Information, to assure the well-being and safety of integrated or relocated entities and society.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: The department should continually work towards the refinement and improvement of its integration and relocation programs and policies based on feedback, assessment outcomes, and changing circumstances.
