## Overview
The Department of Neutralization is The Bureau's last resort for dealing with dangerous anomalies. Mandated to execute neutralization orders, their role kicks in when the Board of Directors decides that an anomaly presents a clear and present danger that cannot be mitigated through containment or relocation.

## Objectives

1. **Neutralization Strategy Development**: Formulate efficient and effective neutralization strategies once an order has been issued.

2. **Neutralization Execution**: Implement the neutralization strategies in a controlled, effective, and efficient manner.

3. **Post-Neutralization Assessment**: Assess the aftermath of each neutralization procedure, managing fallout, and analyzing the efficiency of the operation.

4. **Specialized Training**: Provide intensive training for Bureau agents involved in executing neutralization orders, preparing them for a wide variety of scenarios.

## Codes and Regulations

1. **Directive Compliance**: All neutralization operations are conducted strictly in accordance with directives from the Board of Directors.

2. **Minimal Collateral**: In all neutralization procedures, every effort must be made to minimize collateral damage and potential after-effects.

3. **Transparency**: The department must maintain a comprehensive record of all neutralization operations, including their outcomes and any resulting fallout, available for review by other departments and the Board of Directors.

4. **Accountability**: The Department of Neutralization is accountable for the outcomes of their operations and the management of any unintended consequences.
