## **Overview:**
The Department of Information is the intellectual nerve center of The Bureau. The department's primary purpose is to assess, research, analyze, and categorize the various anomalies encountered by The Bureau. They also play an essential role in documenting findings and disseminating knowledge within the organization and, on occasion, to other approved agencies.

## **Objectives:**

1. **Assessment**: Upon initial encounter with an anomaly, the department is responsible for the immediate assessment, defining its nature, its potential threat level, and if possible, its origin.

2. **Research & Analysis**: Detailed research and comprehensive analysis of each anomaly is conducted to understand its features, abilities, and potential uses or threats. Research teams may employ a wide range of scientific, arcane, and other specialized disciplines as necessary.

3. **Categorization**: Anomalies are categorized based on their nature, threat level, and potential for assimilation or relocation. This system helps streamline the process for other departments, such as Reintegration, Relocation, and Neutralization.

4. **Documentation & Knowledge Management**: The department meticulously records all information, findings, and incident reports related to the anomalies. This central repository of knowledge is maintained with utmost secrecy and security.

5. **Information Dissemination**: The department is also responsible for sharing information within The Bureau and, when necessary, to other approved external agencies. This includes briefing field agents on the nature of the anomalies they will encounter, aiding other departments in formulating appropriate response strategies, and providing redacted information to external parties when required.

## **Codes and Regulations:**

1. **Confidentiality & Security**: All information handled by the department is classified and must be treated with utmost confidentiality. Unauthorized sharing of information is strictly prohibited and will be dealt with severely.

2. **Scientific Rigor**: All research and analysis must adhere to strict scientific standards. Hypotheses and conclusions must be supported by evidence and subject to peer review.

3. **Interdepartmental Collaboration**: Close collaboration with other departments is crucial. Timely and accurate information must be provided to assist in their respective operations.

4. **Ethics in Research**: All research must respect the rights and well-being of sentient anomalies. Cruel or harmful experimental practices are not tolerated.

5. **Continuous Learning**: Given the ever-evolving nature of anomalies, all members of the department are encouraged to pursue continuous learning and professional development in a wide range of relevant disciplines.

6. **Emergency Protocols**: In the event of an information breach or other emergency situations, department members must follow established emergency protocols to contain the situation and mitigate any potential damage.
