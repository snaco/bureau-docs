1. **Assess/Research**: The Bureau's primary directive is the identification, study, and understanding of paranormal phenomena. Bureau agents should approach each case with the intent to gather data, investigate patterns, and deduce the nature of the anomalous occurrence. This includes:
    
    - Monitoring and detection of potential anomalies.
    - Initial analysis and categorization of the anomaly.
    - Active and passive data collection and research regarding the anomaly.
    - Dissemination of relevant knowledge within The Bureau and its subsidiary organizations.
    
1. **Assimilate/Relocate**: Upon sufficient understanding of an anomaly, The Bureau takes the necessary steps to safely assimilate or relocate the phenomena. This directive embodies the spirit of coexistence, preferring peaceful integration and adaptation over destructive methods. This includes:
    
    - Assimilation: Facilitating the peaceful coexistence of anomalies within the fabric of our world, where possible, without causing harm to humanity or the anomaly itself.
    - Relocation: When peaceful coexistence is not viable, anomalies will be relocated to a safe, secure location away from the general population, respecting the anomaly's nature as much as possible.
    
1. **Neutralize**: As a last resort, should an anomaly pose an insurmountable threat to humanity, The Bureau is authorized to neutralize the threat. This process involves careful planning and execution to minimize harm to both the anomaly and humanity. This includes:
    
    - Preventive neutralization: Acting on threats that are currently dormant or not immediate but have potential for high-scale destruction.
    - Reactive neutralization: Acting on immediate threats to neutralize active and destructive anomalies.
    - Ensuring that all neutralization processes are carried out in a manner that causes minimal harm to the environment, humanity, and, when possible, the anomaly itself.
    
1. **Collaboration and Respect**: The Bureau's mission can only be accomplished through the collaborative efforts of all its members. We expect mutual respect and the free exchange of ideas among all Bureau personnel. Any discrimination or harassment is strictly prohibited and will be dealt with severely.
    
5. **Confidentiality and Discretion**: The Bureau's operations often involve sensitive information that could create public unrest if leaked. All Bureau personnel are required to maintain strict confidentiality about our operations, investigations, and findings, unless specifically authorized to disclose such information.
    
6. **Professionalism and Dedication**: Bureau personnel are expected to demonstrate the highest level of professionalism in all their interactions, both within The Bureau and with the public. Dedication to The Bureau's mission is a cornerstone of our organization, and a commitment all Bureau personnel are expected to uphold.

The Bureau Code of Operations is a guide, not a rigid set of rules. Each operation is unique and requires flexibility, initiative, and sound judgement from our personnel. We trust our personnel to act in the best interests of humanity and The Bureau.

Remember, our mission is not just to contain the unknown, but to understand it, to adapt to it, and, where possible, to peacefully coexist with it.

It is in this spirit that The Bureau operates.
