## Addendum: Anomaly-002.1 Field Team Chi-223 Field Report

A deceased specimen of a Gug has been recovered and transported back to the Foundation for further study. The field report indicates that there might be more of these creatures or potentially other anomalous entities in a network of caves that warrants further investigation. Given the observed aggressive nature of the Gug and its potential for causing substantial harm, until containment procedures are developed, field operatives should focus on swift incapacitation or neutralization of the Anomaly. The creature's reason for covering itself in gore/viscera is unknown, suggesting unknown behaviors or abilities that necessitate further study.The team also noted that their actions remained undetected, maintaining operational secrecy.
