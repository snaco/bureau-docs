## **Anomaly Designation: Anomaly-4702 "The Necrotic Horde"**

## **Object Class: ~~Euclid~~ Keter**

## **Special Containment Procedures**:

Containment of Anomaly-4702 is not viable, the Department of Neutralization should be dispatched immediately upon detection. Instances of Anomaly-4072 are to be incinerated immediately upon detection. Sites with reported Anomaly-4702 infestations are to be quarantined and thoroughly sterilized. Information about Anomaly-4702 is to be suppressed from public knowledge under Protocol-28 ("Z-Day Prevention").

## **Description**:

Anomaly-4702 denotes a collective of animate human corpses, commonly referred to as "zombies". Instances exhibit a significant decay of cognitive function and physical decomposition yet are capable of locomotion and demonstrate aggressive behavior. Anomaly-4702 instances are able to transmit their condition via a bite-based infection mechanism.

## **Addendum-4702.1: Classification Upgrade**

As of [REDACTED], the classification of Anomaly-4702 has been upgraded from Euclid to Keter. This decision follows the observation of escalating threat levels associated with recent instances of Anomaly-4702.

New instances have demonstrated an enhanced ability to spread the infection more rapidly and extensively than previous cases. Moreover, the infection now exhibits a longer dormancy period, allowing infected hosts to unknowingly spread the contagion over greater distances and to a larger number of potential hosts before symptoms manifest.

These developments have drastically escalated the potential scale of outbreaks, necessitating increased caution, rapid response, and stringent containment measures. Investigations into improved containment strategies and potential neutralization methodologies are currently underway.
