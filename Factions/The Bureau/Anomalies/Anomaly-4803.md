## **Anomaly Designation: Anomaly-4803 "The Deep Dweller"**

## **Object Class: Euclid**

## **Special Containment Procedures**:

Anomaly-4803 instances are contained within large aquatic enclosures simulating deep-sea conditions. These enclosures are to be equipped with pressure-resistant viewing ports for observation. Direct interaction with Anomaly-4803 instances is prohibited due to the high pressure and cold temperatures of their habitats.

## **Description**:

Anomaly-4803 refers to a species of colossal aquatic creatures reminiscent of the mythical "Kraken." Instances possess multiple long, tentacle-like appendages and a large, beaked mouth. Anomaly-4803 instances have shown the capability to create large whirlpools and are capable of ensnaring and dismembering sizeable seafaring vessels. Their diet primarily consists of large aquatic fauna, but instances have been observed to consume virtually anything that they can ensnare within their tentacles.
