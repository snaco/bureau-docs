## **Anomaly Designation: Anomaly-8302 "Dimensional Shambler"**

## **Object Class: Keter**

## **Special Containment Procedures**:

All known instances of Anomaly-8302 are to be monitored closely through remote multidimensional surveillance devices, given the anomaly's potential to appear in any location, at any time. Due to the creature's ability to bypass most physical and magical barriers, containment is largely focused on rapid response measures upon detection of an instance. Small, magically warded containment units have shown efficacy in preventing their emergence.

Agents should be on high alert for signs of abduction or astral disturbances suggestive of Anomaly-8302 activity. Victims should be rescued as swiftly as possible to prevent the establishment of long-term astral trails.

## **Description**:

Anomaly-8302, also known as the Dimensional Shambler, is a semi-humanoid entity of unknown origin, known to inhabit the interdimensional emptiness referred to as the "Nothing". Its physiology includes a smooth, partially featureless head and large, grasping claws. Beyond its physical form, the entity has been observed to possess several abilities of a profoundly unsettling nature.

The creature has the ability to freely transition between different planes of existence, appearing in any location seemingly at will. It can bypass most physical and magical barriers, and instances have been known to abduct individuals, transporting them across dimensions.

When Anomaly-8302 attacks, it often transports its victims to alien realities, leaving them to fend for themselves in often hostile or otherwise inhospitable conditions. The victim's presence in the alternate dimension creates an "astral trail", an energy differential between the origin and target universes that Anomaly-8302 is able to feed off.

While instances of Anomaly-8302 do not typically deposit their victims in immediately dangerous universes, the alternate realities chosen are typically sufficiently alien and hostile to cause significant distress and potential psychological trauma.

## **Addendum**-8302.1:

Recent studies suggest that Anomaly-8302's feeding process is dependent on the victim's survival for at least a few hours, and the subsequent astral trail begins to dissipate upon the victim's death or assimilation into the new reality.

Additional research is required to develop a comprehensive understanding of Anomaly-8302's physiology, trans-dimensional abilities, and energy-feeding mechanisms to better counteract its threat and improve containment procedures.
