## **Anomaly Designation: Anomaly-4703 "The Lycanthrope"**

## **Object Class: Euclid**

## **Special Containment Procedures**:

Anomaly-4703 instances are to be contained in reinforced high-security containment cells. These cells should be fitted with lunar phase simulators which must remain in the "new moon" phase at all times. Regular tranquilizer-based sedation is advised during the expected "full moon" phase.

## **Description**:

Anomaly-4703 refers to a subset of humans who undergo significant physical and psychological transformation during the lunar full moon phase, akin to the folklore creature "werewolf". These transformations involve the enlargement of the body, growth of fur, and development of lupine facial features. During the transformed state, Anomaly-4703 instances demonstrate increased aggression and physical strength.
