## **Overview**
The Bureau is a covert, global organization dedicated to managing the supernatural, paranormal, and extra-normal entities and events that exist outside of the understanding of the general public. Its origins and reach are wide, working subtly behind the scenes to ensure the normality of the world.

## **Directives**
The Bureau operates under three main directives:

1. **Assess/Research:** Through its Department of Information, The Bureau aims to discover, document, and understand supernatural entities and events.

2. **Assimilate/Relocate:** Through the Departments of Integration and Relocation and Reintegration, The Bureau strives to integrate supernatural entities into society wherever possible, or relocate them to areas where they can exist without impacting or disrupting the norm.

3. **Neutralize:** Through the Department of Neutralization, The Bureau is responsible for neutralizing any supernatural threats when such action is deemed necessary by the Bureau's Board of Directors.

## **Structure**
The Bureau is comprised of various departments, each responsible for a specific aspect of its directives. These include the Department of Information, Department of Integration and Relocation, Department of Reintegration, Department of Operations, and Department of Neutralization, among others. Each department has its own unique objectives, codes, and regulations.

The Bureau's executive authority is vested in a Board of Directors, including an Administrator who presides over both The Bureau and the SCP Foundation.

## **Inter-Organizational Relations**
The Bureau has a symbiotic, albeit complex relationship with the SCP Foundation, an organization dedicated to securing, containing, and protecting supernatural entities. In many respects, the SCP Foundation operates as a sub-organization of The Bureau, while maintaining many of its internal procedures and departments.

Despite occasional conflicts, both organizations realize their shared interests and objectives. The Bureau's Department of Inter-Organizational Affairs is responsible for maintaining and managing these interactions.

## **Public Relations**
The Bureau maintains a degree of control and influence over public perception and knowledge about the supernatural through the Department of Public Relations. This department is tasked with disseminating information, managing media outlets, and handling crisis situations to ensure the world at large remains unaware of the supernatural.

## **Legal and Internal Affairs**
The Bureau has its own Legal Affairs Department to handle legal issues and protect the Bureau's interests, as well as an Internal Affairs Department responsible for maintaining the integrity of the Bureau's internal operations and personnel.

## **Training**
The Bureau operates a dedicated training facility known as The Crucible. It is responsible for onboarding new agents, determining their departmental placement, and equipping them with the knowledge and skills required to fulfill the Bureau's directives.
