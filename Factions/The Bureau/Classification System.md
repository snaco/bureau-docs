## Object Class:

|Class|Description|
|---|---|
|**Safe**|Safe-class Anomalies are anomalies that are easily and safely contained. This is often due to the fact that the Foundation has researched the Anomaly well enough that containment does not require significant resources or that the anomalies require a specific and conscious activation or trigger. Classifying an Anomaly as Safe, however, does not mean that handling or activating it does not pose a threat.|
|**Euclid**|Euclid-class Anomalies are anomalies that require more resources to contain completely or where containment isn't always reliable. Usually this is because the Anomaly is insufficiently understood or inherently unpredictable. Euclid is the Object Class with the greatest scope, and it's usually a safe bet that an Anomaly will be this class if it doesn't easily fall into any of the other standard Object Classes. As a note, any Anomaly that's autonomous, sentient and/or sapient is generally classified as Euclid, due to the inherent unpredictability of an object that can act or think on its own.|
|**Keter**|Keter-class Anomalies are anomalies that are exceedingly difficult to contain consistently or reliably, with containment procedures often being extensive and complex. The Foundation often can't contain these Anomalies well due to not having a solid understanding of the anomaly, or lacking the technology to properly contain or counter it. A Keter Anomaly does not mean the Anomaly is dangerous, just that it is simply very difficult or costly to contain.|
|**Neutralized**|Neutralized Anomalies are anomalies that are no longer anomalous, either through having been intentionally or accidentally destroyed, or disabled.|
|**Thaumiel**|Thaumiel-class Anomalies are anomalies that the Foundation specifically uses to contain other Anomalies. Even the mere existence of Thaumiel-class objects is classified at the highest levels of the Foundation and their locations, functions, and current status are known to few Foundation personnel outside of the O5 Council.|
|**Apollyon**|Apollyon-class Anomalies are anomalies that cannot be contained, are expected to breach containment imminently, or some other similar scenario. Such anomalies are usually associated with world-ending threats or a [K-Class Scenario](https://Anomaly.fandom.com/wiki/K-Class_Scenario "K-Class Scenario") of some kind and require a massive effort from the Foundation to deal with.|
|**Archon**|Archon-class Anomalies are anomalies that could theoretically be contained but are best left uncontained for some reason. Archon Anomalies may be a part of consensus reality that is difficult to fully contain or may have adverse effects if put into containment. These Anomalies are not uncontainable—the defining feature of the class is that the Foundation chooses to not put the anomaly into containment.|
