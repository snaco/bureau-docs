# **A Comprehensive History of The Bureau**

## **Overview**

The Bureau was formed in the wake of the Salem Witch Trials, a pivotal event that saw the near extinction of non-human races from the Earth. This period of history was a dark one, filled with fear, suspicion, and violence against those who were considered "different." The Bureau was established under the guidance of THE BOARD. THE BOARD's motive was to ensure the protection of the surviving non-human races and to restore a semblance of balance to a world teetering on the brink of chaos.

## **The First Three Departments**

In the early days of the Bureau, there were three primary departments, each playing a critical role in preserving the non-human races and fostering coexistence.

**1. Department of Research:** This department was the first to be established. Its role was to understand the non-human races, their cultures, powers, and needs. The researchers dedicated their efforts to learning as much as possible to aid integration and ensure the survival of these races. 

**2. Department of Integration & Relocation:** Once the research was carried out, the data was passed on to this department. Their job was to ensure the safe integration of non-human races into society where possible, or to relocate them to safe zones where they could exist undisturbed. Their work was crucial in maintaining peace and preventing further mass hysteria.

**3. Department of Public Relations:** This department had the challenging task of managing the public's perception of the non-human races. They worked tirelessly to quell fears and disseminate false information that they were in fact all eradicated.

## **The Addition of Other Departments**

As the years rolled by and the Bureau expanded, new threats and challenges arose, necessitating the formation of additional departments.

**Department of Operations:** Formed after a series of hostile encounters with anomalous entities, this department was established to provide a line of defense against threats and ensure the safety of both the public and non-human races. 

**Department of Information:** Created in response to an escalating number of unknown anomalies, this department focused on gathering, analyzing, and distributing essential information regarding these entities.

**Department of Internal Affairs:** As the Bureau grew larger, so did the need for an internal governing body to oversee operations and maintain order. This department ensured the Bureau's integrity remained intact.

**Department of Legal Affairs:** With the complexity of interactions between humans and non-human races, legal issues arose. This department was created to navigate these challenges and create policies and procedures that promoted fairness and equality.

**Department of Neutralization:** Formed as a response to anomalies deemed too dangerous or uncontrollable, this department was given the grave responsibility of neutralizing these threats when necessary.

**The Crucible:** The increase in the Bureau's scope of operations required a dedicated training department. Thus, The Crucible was established to equip new agents with the knowledge, skills, and mindset necessary to handle the demands of their roles.

**Department of Inter-Organizational Affairs:** As the Bureau expanded, so did its need to coordinate and collaborate with other organizations. This department was established to foster these relationships, most notably with the Foundation, which was formed to deal with larger-scale anomalies.

## **The Formation of The Foundation**

After several centuries, the Bureau faced a challenge unlike any before: a large-scale anomaly that threatened the balance they had been working to maintain. To meet this challenge, they established the Foundation. This sub-organization focused on containment and research of these larger-scale anomalies, working closely with the Bureau but maintaining a large degree of independence. The Foundation was and remains an integral part of the Bureau's operations, ensuring the world's protection from the most significant anomalous threats.
